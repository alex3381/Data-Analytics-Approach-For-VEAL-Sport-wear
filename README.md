Enhancing Sales Performance and Profitability in Regional Retail Channels: A Data Analytics Approach  for VEAL Sportswear


1. INTRODUCTION

VEAL is a top-rated sportswear manufacturer producing sportswear for men and women, operating through six retail locations across five geological regions: Midwest, Northeast, South, Southeast, and West. The company's product portfolio includes two major categories, namely footwear and apparel, distributed through diverse channels. VEAL's product line consists of athletic and street footwear, as well as apparel for both males and females.

1.1 PROBLEM STATEMENT

VEAL is currently facing challenges, particularly insufficient or negligible sales in the South, Southeast, and Northeast regions. Slow sales have led to a revenue shift between channels, possibly influenced by factors such as shifts in consumer preferences, limited promotional activity, and intense competition. As a result, sales performance has declined, adversely affecting revenue and profit. Nonetheless, there is an opportunity to enhance sales performance between the two product categories.

This study aims to probe the dataset for Veal, understand the nature of the problems, offer appropriate remedies, and make better decisions utilizing decision support systems. Decision aid tools, engaging systems based on computers, empower managers to use information and models to tackle challenges. Decision support systems, commonly referred to as 'Business Intelligence,' combine human intellectual capacity with computer-based systems to raise the standard of decisions.

This article provides an overview of how Business Intelligence (BI) can be utilized to improve sales performance in low-performing regions. Management and various departmental teams at Veal must sift through data for reasons and patterns to enable them to make informed decisions swiftly. Using data, situations, and performances from the past and present years, the company will be able to unearth insights and establish distinct plans for each target market.

2. THEORETICAL FRAMEWORK

Management should assess opportunities for improving existing businesses through the implementation of a market-penetration strategy, delving deeper into present marketplaces, drawing in fresh clientele, and convincing current clients to buy more frequently. Management should then develop a market-development strategy to identify or create new markets for its current products. Additionally, they should evaluate the feasibility of developing new products tailored to their current markets. Veal will also evaluate the potential to launch novel products in other areas, adopting a diversification strategy.

2.1 COMPETITIVE ANALYSIS

It is necessary to examine the competitive terrain for Veal, analyzing factors such as strategies (cost leadership and differentiation) and competitive forces. This analysis provides insight into how other brands are performing in regions with low sales.

2.2 SUPPLY CHAIN OPTIMIZATION

To meet sales and consumer demands, the ideas of supply chain optimization and distribution network are crucial. Veal needs to evaluate if its supply chain activities are tailored to meet the needs of each location. Operational monitoring and information accessibility within Veal, throughout its ecosystem, can be provided by enabling technology like supply chain management (SCM) systems.

2.3 DATA-BASED DECISION-PROCESS

Data-based decision-process, defined as the act of making decisions based on information rather than gut feeling, includes business practices related to external and internal data collection and analysis. Veal struggles with sales performance and needs a data-based decision-process.

2.4 BIG DATA ANALYTICS ADOPTION

Big Data is a remarkable variety of data types that are sent at different speeds and frequencies. It investigates minute particulars of Veal's business processes and customer interactions. In addition, there is high-end analytics, an assemblage of various application kinds, which can analyze huge data to comprehend and make sense of Veal's transactions. By leveraging big data and analytics, Veal can efficiently respond to market developments and adjust its tactics based on real-time data by promoting a data-driven approach.

3.1 THE DATA-DRIVEN APPROACH

To harness the benefits of big data, a business intelligence system will be developed to assess the impact of exploited data on the companyâ€™s performance. In this context, the procedures associated with employing huge data are split into two levels: data management and data analysis. Level one covers processes and layers for sourcing, storing, drilling, and preparing data for analysis, while level two discusses strategies for deciphering and utilizing massive data sets for insightful analysis. Business Intelligence systems process significant volumes of highly accurate information, housed in a centralized repository, to facilitate decision-making.


3.2 BUSINESS INTELLIGENCE SYSTEM (DATA ANALYSIS)

The ability of Veal to acquire information and generate useful knowledge, derived from data analysis, represents their true competitive advantage (Kopanakis et al., 2016).

3.2.1 DASHBOARD CREATION

Dashboards, as visualization tools, contain multiple layers of graphical data designed to detect exceptions. They communicate performance status and trends to the operational, tactical, and strategic levels within an organization, allowing for the timely implementation of actions (Eckerson, 2016).
